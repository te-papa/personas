##About Wendy
I don’t have a lot of money, and most of my time and effort goes into my family. Personally, I’d rather read a trashy magazine and have a coffee than hang out in a museum, but it keeps the kids occupied when it’s raining and it’s a nice place to hang out with the parents. You’d call me a relaxed moderate. I speak some te reo Māori and I’m keen for my kids to learn more. I’m comfortable using Facebook, but I don’t spend a lot of time online. Often I visit the Museum with my kids, or with my parents. My mum sometimes needs a wheelchair – she can’t stand up for long periods – so we need a wheelchair when we’re at the Museum. I’ve never visited Te Papa’s website – I already know when it opens and I find out about events on Facebook or your newsletter.

##My needs
* Practical information – what’s on for kids, how to visit with her parent who needs a wheelchair
* To quickly find relevant information – she doesn’t have time to navigate through the website
* To make sure her parents and kids have a good time

##My pain points
* I find it difficult to find logistical information to plan my day
* I’m frustrated by all this other stuff in my way
* Incorrect or out of date information ruins my day

##Website must haves
If I use the Te Papa website it’s got to:

* Have categorisation and related “right now” information
* Push info to the channels I use – social and newsletters
* Help me visit with elderly / disabled visitors and young children


##I want you to
