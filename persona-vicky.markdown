##About Vicky
I was born in Nelson and have lived here all my life. Family and community are both very important to me.  I’m semi-retired, but I love to think and keep busy, and I’m very interested in the cultural sector. You’d call me a cultural enthusiast.

I’m well-read and knowledgeable about my local museum and area, although I don’t have a university degree. I’ve been trying to teach myself to use the internet – but it takes a lot of patience and my connection isn’t very good. I’ve got poor vision so sometimes I struggle to read websites.  
I love to be involved in my community and to share what I know with others. Te Papa’s resources are really helpful for this.

##My needs
I need:

* Professionally relevant, accurate, up-to-date and authoritative resources and information
* Information that’s easy to find
* Interesting information that’s clear, accessible and easy to digest
* To understand how I can use and re-use the information

##My pain points
* I find it difficult to get professional information for my small district museum
* I’m frustrated by having terrible internet and no money at my museum
* Not getting help when I need it ruins my day
* I find it difficult with the general lack of resources appropriate for me
* I’m frustrated by lack of access to a community and relevant resources – I feel disconnected
* I’m frustrated when I can’t read a website – for example if their text is too small

##Website must haves
If I use the Te Papa website it’s got to:

* help me find resources and information – a good search is important!
* show related content so I can find out more
* help me contact experts and a museum community
* provide remote access and remote learning opportunities
* have information that I can re-use
* have practical information on the topic I want – or point me to a place that does
* have easy to understand information
* tell me what I can and can’t do with the information I find

##I want to

* learn more and extend my knowledge
* be guided by experts
* get help with issues important to my museum
* be informed
