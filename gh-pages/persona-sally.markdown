##About Sally
I’m young, I don’t have much money yet, and I mostly use the internet for fun. I love social media (usually Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat) and being around my friends. I learn best by doing and having fun – I don’t like reading books. You’d call me a social fun seeker. I sometimes visit the Museum with my family – hardly ever with my friends. I don’t visit Te Papa’s website – why would I?

##My needs
* To be entertained and engaged
* To do fun stuff
* To finish a school project
* To socialise, share and have fun with friends
* Information fast  – I’d rather be doing something else

##My pain points
* I find it difficult to identify with Te Papa
* I’m frustrated by the fact nothing you have relates to me
* Not being connected like I want ruins my day
* I find it difficult to motivate myself to work
* I’m frustrated by too many boring words
* I don’t have time to spend ages looking for stuff

##Website must haves
I’m more likely to use social media than a website. If I use the Te Papa website it’s got to:


* use the channels I use – social
* not be dumb
* not talk down to me
* be free
* be relevant
* be where I am
* have actually engaging content
* not be too stuffy
* be understandable
* help me find and use stuff for school

##I want you to
* Entertain me
* Impress me
* Inspire me
* Inform me
