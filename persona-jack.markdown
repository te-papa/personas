##About Jack
This is my first time in Wellington – I’ve got limited time and I want to see everything I can! Te Papa’s in the Lonely Planet as one of the Top 10 things to do in New Zealand, so I should probably visit. English is my second language, so sometimes I struggle to understand everything I read or hear.
I’m still pretty young and I love to travel and experience new things. I’m really into both nature and technology, and I like stuff that makes me think. I’m visiting New Zealand for the first time and I’m interested in finding out more about New Zealand culture and history, especially Māori culture – you’d call me a keen participant. I’m travelling alone and spend a lot of time keeping in contact with friends and family back home, usually through Skype, Facebook or SnapChat.

##Attributes

* Heavy mobile user
* Low engagement with Te Papa
* Not invested in Te Papa
* Reasonably literate (but English as a second language)
* Has competing demands on digital attention
* Needs content to be pushed
* Expects low effort to engage

##My needs
* Practical information – what’s on, how to plan a visit
* To quickly find relevant information – I doesn’t have time to navigate through the website
* Information on Te Papa’s highlights – what should I definitely see?
* To be convinced to visit Te Papa – is this how I should spend my time in Wellington?
* To buy tickets
* To find my way at the Museum
* To find out more about that cool thing I saw in the Museum
* To share photos from his trip with friends and family

##My pain points
* I find it difficult to find my way around Te Papa’s website
* I’m frustrated by lack of clear “package” online – I need you to help me use my time at the Museum
* I hate standing in line – missing the cool stuff ruins my day
* Your website doesn’t make me want to visit the Museum – it’s a bit boring

##Website must haves
If I use the Te Papa website it’s got to:

* Show me the basic information I need – when, where and how
* Work well on my mobile and tablet
* Persuade me to visit – there’s loads of other things to do in Wellington
* Let me buy tickets so I can skip the queues

##I want you to
* Impress me
* Entertain me
* Inform me
