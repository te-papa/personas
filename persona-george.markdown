##About George
I’m into sports and the outdoors, tech and New Zealand history. I’m pretty passionate about my hobbies! You’d call me an outdoorsy traditionalist. I’m fairly literate and I know my way around the internet – self-taught, largely. I don’t use social media though, it’s a waste of time.
I’m not particularly invested in Te Papa, but I’ll be stoked if you have information on my hobby. I spend most of my time online researching my subject of interest.
I like pictures and videos and things I can take away or do things with. I don’t want to read heaps of academic-sounding stuff, but I’m happy to read in-depth about a subject that interests me.

##My needs
* Accurate, up-to-date and authoritative information on the topic that interests me
* Information that’s easy to find

* To understand how I can use and re-use the information
* To read the information when I want – on the bus, in front of the TV or in my study

##My pain points
* I find it difficult to know how to search for stuff
* I’m frustrated by not being certain I’ve found everything and not knowing what I don’t know
* I’m frustrated if I’m not sure how accurate the information is
* Finding nothing ruins my day
* Finding something I don’t understand puts me off your website
