##About Sharon
I’m a teacher in Auckland and I use teaching resources from all over New Zealand – Te Papa, Canterbury Museum and POND to name a few! I’m pretty literate and relatively digitally savvy, but I still like to print things for my classroom.
I like Te Papa – it’s our national museum after all – but it’s pretty hard for me to get me and my class there. Sometimes I forget that you provide education resources – I generally find them through Google rather than going straight to your websites.

I try to include te reo and Māori concepts in my classes, but it can be hard for me to find resources. My class love it when I connect them with experts – people who are passionate about their subject. I love history and learning about New Zealand – you’d call me a cultural enthusiast. I’m in a community of dedicated teachers in Auckland, and I like to share useful resources and findings with them.

##My needs
* To complete a lesson plan for my classes
* To find and share all the resources Te Papa has for my students’ age group
* To excite my students about the topics I teach
* To easily find authoritative, trustworthy subject-based resources that I can use in my classroom
* To understand how I can use and re-use the resources
* Professional development and training
* To see what’s on at (and maybe book)  Te Papa for schools – self-guided tours and hosted by educators
* To connect her class with experts at Te Papa – digitally, as and when she needs – either live or via filmed resources (e.g. when she’s teaching that topic e.g. feathers – wants to speak to a vertebrate curator, or a major event e.g. earthquakes – she wants to be able to point to Hamish)

##My pain points
* I find it difficult to find time to plan
* I’m frustrated by not being able to see what’s suitable for my class
* Unusable resources ruin my day
* I find it difficult to find relevant resources
* I’m frustrated by not knowing I can book, opening irrelevant crap
* Incessant clicking makes me grumpy
* Not knowing how to find a real person to speak to at Te Papa is really frustrating

##Website must haves
If I use the Te Papa website it’s got to:

* categorisation by age, subject, topic and levels
* easy to find stuff I can use in my classroom
* easy to understand resources I can remix or use as they are
* things that I can share with peers
* clear navigation and an easy search so I can find what I need
* shareability/ease of takeaways (reword)
* a way to book education experiences
* make it clear what I can and can’t do with the resources I find

##I want you to
* Guide me
* Inform me
* Inspire me
* Involve me
